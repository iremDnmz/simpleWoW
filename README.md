Simple version of “Words of Wonders” mobile game.

There are three main parts in the game. At the bottom of the page, there is a widget to enter letters of the words. By clicking the mouse left button, a letter is selected, and appended to the current word. The selected letter is highlighted and cannot be selected again. In the middle of the widget, an shuffle icon is shown. If you click on it, it shuffles the letters. After starting a word, you cannot shuffle the letters. If you enter a word in the solution, it shows in the puzzle part. The last part is represented by an “bulb” icon, which reveals all letters in the puzzle.
